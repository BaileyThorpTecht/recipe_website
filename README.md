---- progress report ----  

20/3/24 week 7 day 3  
I have finished following all 42 videos of the django tutorial by sean  
I now have a website with essentially all of the functionality I need. Now I just need to expand it to fit the requirement  
except for registration. that doesnt work  
I still dont really understand how login/logout/create/delete works by connecting to the database, but I dont think i need to. Its all already handled by django.

todo: make registration work then make it all fit the requirements
add tags for category/subcategory to recipes. remember to add it to create and update and view
more pages  



No more progress reports. commits have brief updates and todos are kept externally
